# Restaurant-Billing-System---COAL-Project
This project is a console-based Restaurant Billing System developed in MASM Assembly language using the Irvine32 library. It simulates a simple restaurant order management and billing system, allowing users to choose menu items, specify quantities, and generate a detailed bill with itemized costs.
